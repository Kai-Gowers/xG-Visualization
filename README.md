# xG-Visualization

This project aims to visualize how a Machine Learning Model may predict the Expected Goals (xG) of any given shot in a soccer game.

Project structure:
- Implemented a Random Forest model for xG predictions
- React for the front-end
- FastAPI for the back-end

I hope this helps build intuition!
